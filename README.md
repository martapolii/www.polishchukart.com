This repository contains the code for a personal website built for Ihor Polishchuk, a Toronto-based artist. The website is designed to showcase his extensive body of work, including a gallery of his paintings, a CV section with details about his exhibitions, and a contact page.

The website features:
- Home Page: A hero image with links to the gallery.
- Gallery Pages: Two pages showcasing paintings, each image clickable for more details in an overlay.
- CV Page: A detailed curriculum vitae listing solo and group exhibitions.
- Contact Page: Provides contact information and links to social media profiles.
  
Key Features:
- Gallery Overlay: A JavaScript-powered overlay to display full-size images with captions.
- Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile views with media queries.
- Mobile Navigation: Hamburger menu for easy navigation on smaller screens.
- CSS Styling: Custom styles for the layout, typography, and gallery design.

This project demonstrates my ability to create a visually engaging and fully functional website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Working on:
- improving page layout on mobile devices
- revamping the home screen
- adding more information to the overlays for each painting (painting description, etc)
- debugging the grid - since I made a 'custom' grid layout to emphasize certain paintings, I find that at certainb aspect ratios the grid'breaks' and images are no longer contained in their containers, or css properties conflict
